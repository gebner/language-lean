# Lean

Language support for the [Lean](http://leanprover.github.io/) programming language.

Currently we only support basic syntax highlighting but hope to reach feature
parity with the Emacs mode, as well as eventually add debugger and profiling
support to the editor mode.

Feature List
- Latex symbol input
- Flycheck style errors
- TODO fill in
